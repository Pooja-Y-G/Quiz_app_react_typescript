React, Typescript, Styled Components, API call has been done in QUIZ app demo


To add TypeScript to a Create React App project, first install it and its respective @types:

npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

â€¦ or:

yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

TypeScript checks for types at compile-time and throws errors if the variable type changes.
